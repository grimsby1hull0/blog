                    Felt like making something, just passed my driving test today so I'm pretty chuffed with that. <br><br>
                    Off to Uni in less than a week, flat mates seem sound, looking forward to it. 
                    <br><br>
                    Just been doing a few mobile optimisation bits for other sites on the domain whilst I was making this one. 
                    Never really had a blog before, see how it goes.
                    <br><br> 
                    It's nothing fancy, but I enjoy having a decent online presence and hosting projects and stuff on here. 
                    Got a Nextcloud server running on my Pi recently, works a treat and should be ideal for Uni 
                    (especially having a Calendar/To Do list that will sync with my phone)

                    Should probably start packing soon, bubblewrap is on the way so we'll see how that whole 
                    thing goes.
